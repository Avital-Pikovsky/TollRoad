# TollRoad
## Final Project in Big Data course

• The system will enable the management of sections of the toll road, 5 sections in which cars enter and leave regularly.

• At any moment you can know the number of cars in each section.

• The system will display on a dashboard the current number of cars and will allow you to request a breakdown of the list of cars.

• There is also an option to see how many cars there are on the road by types at any given moment.

• The system will build a decision model based on a decision tree with bigML: given the details of the road section, type of the car, day of the week and time
car entry, a prediction will be made about which section the car will exit.
